**EcoTherm** is an R package designed for analyzing and visualizing ecological and thermodynamic data. It provides a collection of functions that simplify the process of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and graphical representation specific to ecological studies.

## Installation

EcoTherm is currently only available on GitHub. You can install it using one of the following methods:

### Using `pak`
```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("donaldfogang/EcoTherm")
```

### Using `devtools`
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donaldfogang/EcoTherm")
```

## Usage

**EcoTherm** is designed to assist thermal power plants in optimizing their thermal processes while minimizing environmental impact. The package offers a comprehensive suite of functions that enable users to:

- **Calculate Enthalpy Changes:** Accurately compute enthalpy changes to assess energy efficiency in thermal processes.
- **Analyze Efficiency:** Evaluate the efficiency of thermal systems and identify opportunities for improvement.
- **Forecast Profits:** Use historical data to forecast potential profits based on operational efficiency.
- **Visualize Data Trends:** Create informative visualizations to identify trends and patterns in energy production and consumption.
- **Recommend Emission Reduction Strategies:** Generate actionable insights for reducing emissions and enhancing sustainability practices.

By utilizing EcoTherm, users can enhance their operational efficiency, improve profitability, and contribute to environmental sustainability in energy production.

### Example

Here’s a brief example of how you might use EcoTherm to analyze thermal efficiency:

Here’s a brief example of how you might use EcoTherm to analyze enthalpy and pollution levels:

```r
library(EcoTherm)

# Example data
user_data <- data.frame(
  region = c("USA", "Canada", "Brazil", "France", "Germany",
             "China", "India", "Australia", "Russia", "Japan",
             "Argentina", "Mexico", "UK", "Italy", "South Africa",
             "Nigeria", "Saudi Arabia", "Indonesia", "Turkey",
             "Iran", "Thailand", "Vietnam", "Spain", "Poland",
             "Netherlands"),
  enthalpy = runif(25, 100, 500)  # Random values between 100 and 500
)

# Analyze enthalpy in relation to pollution thresholds
results <- enthalpy_pollution(user_data, pollution_threshold = 300)

# View results
print(results)
```
